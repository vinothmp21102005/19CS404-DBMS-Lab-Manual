# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
## Name: VINOTH M P
## Reg.no: 212222040182
## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

*Types:*
- *Single-row subquery*:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- *Multiple-row subquery*:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- *Correlated subquery*:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

*Example:*
sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
*Create View:*
sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

*Drop View:*
sql
DROP VIEW view_name;


*Question 1*

Write a SQL query to List departments with names longer than the average length

Departments Table

SELECT department_id,department_name
from Departments
WHERE LENGTH (department_name)>
(
SELECT AVG(LENGTH(department_name))
FROM Departments
)

*Output:*

*Question 2*

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $1500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY

1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500 3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500 6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500

7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000

SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 1500;


*Output:*

*Question 3*

Write a SQL query to Find employees who have an age less than the average age of employees with incomes over 2.5 Lakh

SELECT id,name,age,city,income
FROM Employee
WHERE age < (
    SELECT AVG(age)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE income > 250000
);

*Output:*

*Question 4*

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose AGE is LESS than $30

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY

1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500 3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500 6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500

7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000

SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE AGE < 30;

*Output:*

*Question 5*

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose Address as Delhi

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY

1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500 3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500 6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500

7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000

SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE ADDRESS = 'Delhi';

*Output:*

*Question 6*

From the following tables write a SQL query to find salespeople who had more than one customer. Return salesman_id and name.

salesman table

name type

salesman_id numeric(5) name varchar(30) city varchar(15) commission decimal(5,2)

customer table

name type

customer_id int cust_name text city text grade int salesman_id int


SELECT s.salesman_id, s.name
FROM salesman s
JOIN customer c ON s.salesman_id = c.salesman_id
GROUP BY s.salesman_id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1;

*Output:*

*Question 7*

Write a query to display all the customers whose ID is the difference between the salesperson ID of Mc Lyon and 2001.

salesman table

name type

salesman_id numeric(5) name varchar(30) city varchar(15) commission decimal(5,2)

customer table

name type

customer_id int cust_name text city text grade int salesman_id int

SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = (
    SELECT s.salesman_id - 2001
    FROM salesman s
    WHERE s.name = 'Mc Lyon'
);

*Output:*

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $4500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY

1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000 2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500 3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500 6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500

7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000


SELECT * 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 4500;

*Output:*
