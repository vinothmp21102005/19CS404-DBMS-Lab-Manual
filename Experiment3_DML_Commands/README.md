# Experiment 3: DML Commands
## Name: VINOTH M P
## Reg.no:212222040182
## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
*Syntax (Single Row):*
```
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
*Syntax (Multiple Rows):*
```
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
*Syntax (Insert from another table):*
```
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
*Syntax (All rows):*
```
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
*Syntax (Specific condition):*
```
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
*Syntax:*
```
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### *Question 1*

Write a SQL statement to update the product_name as 'Grapefruit' whose product_id is 4 in the products table.
```
update products
set product_name='Grapefruit'
where product_id=4;

### *Output:*

### *Question 2*

Write a SQL query to reduce the reorder level by 30% where cost price is more than 50 and quantity in stock is less than 100 in the products table.
```
update Products
set reorder_lvl=reorder_lvl*0.7
where cost_price>50 and quantity<100;
```
### *Output:*

```
delete from Surgeries 
where surgery_date='2024-02-28';
```
### *Output:*

where EmpLname like '%A' and length(EmpLname)=5;
```
### *Output:*

### *Question 6*

Write a SQL query to classify base in the Calculations table as 'Provided' if it is not NULL, otherwise 'Not Provided'.
```
select id,base,
case when base is not NULL then 'Provided'
else 'Not Provided'
end as base_status
from Calculations;
```
### *Output:*

### *Question 7*

Write a SQL query to calculate the final price after applying both the discount and the tax. Return product_id, original_price, discount_percentage, tax_rate, and final_price.
```
select product_id,original_price,discount_percentage,tax_rate,(original_price*(1-discount_percentage))*(1+tax_rate) as final_price
from products;
```
### *Output:*

### *Question 8*

Create a report that shows the capitalized FirstName and capitalized LastName renamed as FirstName and Lastname respectively and EmployeeId from the employees table sorted by EmployeeId in descending order.
```
select upper(FirstName) AS FirstName,upper(LastName) AS LastName,EmployeeId
from employees
order by EmployeeID desc;
```
### *Output:*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdff8b34-9326-409f-9a0f-184c53772e6c)

### *Question 9*

Write a SQL statement to retrieve city(column name) of all customers from customers table without any repeats.
```
select distinct city from customers;
```
### *Output:*
